# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction

Description: Utilizing over 4,000 days of historical stock price data, this project focuses on improving market insights and predictive accuracy through the development of an advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model implemented with the Keras library. By effectively capturing the sequential nature of stock price movements, the model demonstrates an 86.11% reduction in model loss and achieves an impressive 99.5% accuracy. This work highlights a deep understanding of stock market dynamics and predictive modeling techniques, offering valuable contributions to stock price forecasting.
